
Description:

the Product listing page, by demonstrating voice listing of an item, and the app will auto populate the standard description and the market price, then the use will only enter the colour options and the product state (new, used good condition, used bad condition). Let sample with 5 second-hand items (electric iron, Samsung 22 inche TV,  cellphone full height stand with round light, hardcopy Oxford dictionary, Raleigh bicycle). Use JavaScript, html, CSS to suggest full code files


How It Works:

Let's approach this by swapping the order of events:

Step 1: The user clicks the "Take a Pic" button first.
Step 2: After capturing the image, the user clicks the "Start Voice Input" button to describe the product (e.g., name or details).
Step 3: The user selects the color options and product condition from dropdowns.
Step 4: After submitting, the app will display:
The captured picture.
A description line including the product name (from voice input), color, condition, and a randomly generated price.
